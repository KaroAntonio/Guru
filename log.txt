-> ~ May 27, 2015 :: Implementing Scrapy and Regex
Learning scrapy and regex to scrape house data from zillow. Each Search on the map is accompanied by a list of houses that are scraped by a spide, the map must contain results for no more than 500 houses because beyond that the list does not render all houses.

For determining the url algorithmically, only the properties bounded by the rectangle will be listed, zoom is only for the map

May 31, 2015 :: Zillow Unlimited Property Data
By subdividing a search into smaller scopes, data sets larger than the imposed 500 house limit zillow sets, the problem now is just time, 700 houses takes 16 minutes, zillow lists approxamitely 3 million houses for sale, not to mention the data on houses not currently on the market. This would take a lot of time to scrape, too much. The solution is to scrape in parallel using random proxy IPs. Testing for this is going to have to be done using a test IP that is ok to get blocked...

June 8, 2015 :: Implement Tor
http://pkmishra.github.io/blog/2013/03/18/how-to-run-scrapy-with-TOR-and-multiple-browser-agents-part-1-mac/
in terminal run: to start tor & polipo
$tor
$polipo

Tor is functional, but slow, running multiple spiders at multiple locations would be better
Did a run with a concurrency of 1000 of pheonix and scraped 15000/23000 before getting blocked

An optional route is determine the areas to search via open data:
http://www.zillow.com/research/data/

then perform an in depth search once the best areas have been identified

Using proxies

June 9, 2015 :: Squid Proxies
10 proxies are bought from squid proxies after messing around with public proxies for a while, they're determined to be to unreliable and slow

Jun 11, 2015 :: Price and Tax History
Price History is now also scraped using an ajax response

Jun 18, 2015 :: Increasing Concurrent Scrapes

ERROR FIX: Couldn't bind: 24: Too many open files

To find the limit on the number of files per processor:
launchctl limit

To increase this limit run one of these:
sudo sysctl -w kern.maxfilesperproc=20000
ulimit -S -n 2048

SQLITE # of rows in table:
SELECT Count(*) FROM tblName

Approaches to high concurrency
Run single scrapy instance iterating over multiple sectored urls

Jun 19, 2015 :: Recursive Subdivision
Current Method of dividing the zillow results is slow and a significant number of listings are being lost
In order to deal with this, a new approach will be tried which will recursively subdivide the map into smaller portions 

If map has more than 20 pages of listings:
    subdivide recursively
Else:
    follow rules to extract all house links

Not filtering subdivided requests allows large numbers to be concurrently scraped

Current Speed: 2707 items in 16 mins = 169/min = 2.8/s

the target speed is 100 items/s (sourced from github)

Process DB items into json to be accessed from gh-pages

Benchmark: 9122items/52mins = 175.4/min = 2.92/s

At the current rate, it would take 11 days to scrape the ~3 million properties listed on zillow

Jul 4, 2015 :: Deep Valuation Techniques Survey

Evaluate Houses using expert knowledge techniques:
    http://mres.com/how-to-evaluate-investment-property/
    
Provide an estimate of monthly cashflow
Figure out taxes

IMPORTANT NUMBERS:
Monthly Cashflow
Projected Return on value
Estimate Vacancy rate based on the ratio of the rental rate to the average rental rate in the area

Jul 7, 2015 :: Monte Carlo Valuation 

Finest Expert turns out to have a lot of over lapping functionality
It has more functions for comparisons, And it has [potentially] deeper valuation functions.
The Guru has a deeper pool of properties to draw on, apparently
~10x the size+, for AZ: 5458 vs zillow's 40,930

Jul 12, 2015 :: HOA Filtering and Valuation

Search for keywords that indicate an HOA, parse for the HOA and assume an HOA otherwise.

Value to predict for 

Price in year X

Using As many available variables as possible

Predict Rent also

A statistical analysis: for each variable, record the average YTY variation of price, then for all variable-variations, compose a weighted average variation based on the

Jul 18, 2015 :: Meeting Notes
Scrape city-data for city population growth rates, cross refernace for each city
    maybe only search for positive growth cities

Parse description for HOA fees, assume X for properties with no HOA value

Filter out (mobile), (mobile homes) ... maybe?

list link sources in report

Ability to flag properties according to viewed, good, bad, etc...
